            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p class="verticalStretch"> Throughout this course, I hope to build better mobile applications that serve as a friend to those in need of mental support. 
                 Applications that can allow others to ventilate negative emotions and turn them into positive ones. An application that helps keep 
                 those who are stressed more organized. Create applications that help change how we process emotions, more specifically related to childhood 
                 trauma, into positive ones that last permanently. Support should be available to everyone at any time and I hope to create those mediums.</p>
